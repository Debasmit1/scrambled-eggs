  <div class ="LP">
   <p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin.<br> Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter,<br> with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.</p></div>
