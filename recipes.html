  <p>I adapted this recipe from a book called <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0864119917/"><cite>Sydney Food</cite></a> by Bill Grainger, Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney.I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the <em>best</em> scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>
  <p>This recipe is what I call a &quot;very special breakfast&quot;, just look at ingredients to see why. It has  to be tasted to be believed.</p>
